<b> Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease provides a basis for design of improved a-ketoamide inhibitors</B>
---
The paper below describes the drug discovery process from the protein crystalization to
inhibitor development to cell tests and mouse (PK and ADME). 

Basically they expressed the main protease (SARS-COV-2 Mpro) in Ecoli, purified it, 
then crystalized it using robotic crystallization procedures. They cyrstallized the 
main protease (SARS-COV-2 Mpro) with and without ligands. The structure was then measured
on the Bessy beam line in Berlin with 1.7 Angstrom resolution. An inhibition assay
was performed to check activities. Alpha-ketoamide inhibitors were synthesized,
fully analytically characterized with MS and NMR. Infection experiments on 
Calu-3 human lung cancer cell lines and mice were carried out in a BSL-3
lab (Marburg/Germany). PK and ADME were performed on mouse plasme, microsomal stability
was tested on human and mouse S9 liver microsomes.  Additional pharmacokinetic studies
were performed on outbred male CD-1 mice. 

Additional steps including full pharmacokinetics (PK/PD), ADME, formulation,  toxicity 
testing and human trials (phase I,II,III,IV) are needed  to bring such a drug to the market.


The tBOC (tert-Butyloxycarbonyl) group is needed for inhibitor (13a) to be active,
removal of the group in inhibitor (14b) removes the activity. This is further explained
with the docking pockets. One problem with tBOC groups is of course hydrolysis (stomach acid)
in case of oral delivery, therefore it may never be an oral drug, but has to be administered
intravenously or as proposed in the paper via nebulization directly into the lungs.
