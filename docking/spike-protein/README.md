The novel Wuhan coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been sequenced, and the virus shares substantial similarity
with SARS-CoV. Here, using a computational model of the spike protein (S-protein) of SARS-CoV-2
interacting with the human ACE2 receptor, we make use of the world's most powerful supercomputer,
SUMMIT, to enact an ensemble docking virtual high-throughput screening campaign and identify
small-molecules which bind to either the isolated Viral S-protein at its host receptor region or to the S
protein-human ACE2 interface. We hypothesize the identified small-molecules may be repurposed to limit viral
recognition of host cells and/or disrupt host-virus interactions. A ranked list of compounds is given that can be
tested experimentally.
